&nbsp;  
**Aim**: To characterize the diversity of gene clusters within BREX loci and implement a pipeline to search this kind of loci in metagenomics data.

**Objectives:**
- To implement a workflow for extraction (M) and characterization of variable gene clusters within BREX loci
- To validate the workflow on the open databases
- To arrange the implemented workflow in the form of a Docker container to analyze newly sequenced data
